I run Fedora 33 in an academic environment and mostly refuse to do anything that isn't exactly the way I like it. I also refuse to write in LaTeX or get really good at bash scripts. These are helpful documents or code snippets that I've used to configure my system, usually after wading through a lot of SE threads and error messages.
